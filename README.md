# 🤔Decision Support System
➡️We propose a personal and intelligent DSS that can automatically predict the result of a phone call to sell long term deposits by using a DM approach.
➡️DSS is valuable to assist managers in prioritizing and selecting the next customers to be contacted during bank marketing campaigns. As a consequence, by performing fewer and more effective phone calls, time and costs of such campaigns would be reduced along with client stress and intrusiveness would be diminished.

#### 🤖 Machine learning algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Naive Bayes Classifier 
#### 📈Feature selection techniques used:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Forward Feature Selection Method
#### **It has been found that Support Vector Classifier is doing best job with recall = 0.89, auc score = 0.89**
